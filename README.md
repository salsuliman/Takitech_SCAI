## **Takitech - Football Performance Optimization**

**Takitech** is a football performance analysis tool that leverages advanced data analytics and real-time tactical insights. By analyzing match and training data, Takitech helps coaches and analysts make data-driven decisions to optimize team strategies.

## **Features**
- **Real-time Pressing Intensity Analysis** âš½
- **LLM-powered Tactical Recommendations** ðŸ§ 
- **Data visualization of player positions and intensity** ðŸ“Š
- **Video-based tactical analysis powered by Gemini** ðŸŽ¥

## **Key Functions**
1. **Loading Match Data**:  
   Collects tracking data from Sportecâ€™s open dataset using the `kloppy` library for detailed match analysis.

2. **Pressing Intensity Analysis**:  
   Analyzes the pressing intensity of players using the **Unravel** library, focusing on key metrics like ball possession and defensive pressure.

3. **Data Visualization**:  
   Provides heatmaps, player position tracking, and pressing intensity visualizations using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **mplsoccer** libraries.

4. **Video Creation**:  
   Generates a video showing pressing intensity analysis over time, utilizing `FuncAnimation` for visual updates.

5. **Tactical Analysis with Gemini**:  
   Uploads video analysis to **Gemini** (via `genai` API) to generate detailed tactical reports, providing insights on team performance and suggesting improvements.

## **Dependencies**
- **`numpy`**, **`pandas`**, **`matplotlib`**, **`seaborn`**, **`polars`**, **`mplsoccer`**, **`kloppy`**, **`unravel`**
- **`google.genai`** for connecting to Gemini's API
- **`sportec`** from Kloppy for sports data
- **Gemini API Key**: A valid Gemini API key is required for video analysis.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/takitech.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**

### **Pressing Intensity Analysis**
The main function of the repository, **analyze_pressing_intensity**, performs an in-depth analysis of the team's pressing intensity during specific match periods.

### **Video Creation**
Generate a **pressing intensity video** that visualizes the data in an engaging format:
```python
video_path = create_pressing_intensity_video(model, dataset, OUTPUT_VIDEO)
```

### **Tactical Insights from Gemini**
Analyze the generated video with **Gemini** to get a comprehensive tactical report:
```python
tactical_analysis = analyze_video_with_gemini(video_path)
```

### **Example Workflow**
1. Load match data with the `load_match_data` function.
2. Analyze pressing intensity using `analyze_pressing_intensity`.
3. Generate a video of the pressing intensity with `create_pressing_intensity_video`.
4. Use Gemini to generate tactical analysis from the video.
5. Save the generated analysis to a Markdown file.

## **API Key Setup**

1. Obtain your **Gemini API Key**.
2. Replace the placeholder in the code:
   ```python
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
   ```
